In detail: the API uses the description of a location to retrieve geographic details (like geographical coordinates). The location description can be a postal address, point of interest landmark (like Disneyland) or a place ID (such as an airport, multi-airport city (MAC) code or Sabre ID). These geographic details could then be used to plot locations on a graphical map.
