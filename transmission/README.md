# Transmission

This package provides an abstraction layer on top of the engine package.

It should provide an API that is easy to extend upon for any modifications
needed by a client.

Currently supports a REST-like api with json

## TODO

1. Let's get either gRPC or some kind of protocol buffer API.
1. Let's check this api against soemthing like a graphql frontend.
